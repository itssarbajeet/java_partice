## Introduction

In this repository, I document my journey of practicing and solving DSA problems as part of my preparation for technical interviews and enhancing my problem-solving skills. The problems in this repository are sourced from the DSA sheet provided by Love Babbar, a renowned software engineer and competitive programmer.

## Folder Structure

The repository is structured in a way that makes it easy to navigate and find specific problems. The problems are organized into different folders based on their topic or category. For example, you will find folders like `Arrays`, `Strings`, `Linked Lists`, `Binary Trees`, and so on. Inside each folder, you will find individual problem files with their solutions.

## Problem Descriptions

Each problem file contains the problem description along with my solution in a programming language of my choice (mention your preferred programming language). The solutions are well-documented and include time and space complexity analysis. Additionally, I have tried to provide multiple approaches whenever applicable.

## Contributing

This repository is my personal collection of problem solutions, but if you have any suggestions, improvements, or alternative solutions, feel free to contribute! Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated.
